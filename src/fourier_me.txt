Let's take the fourier transform of me.

What is a fourier transform?
It splits any function into a sum of sinusoidal components.
Each sinusoidal component has a frequency and an amplitude.

This means, for a finite sum of sinusoids, the resulting function is periodic;
it repeats itself after a certain amount of time.

Each sinusoid has a frequency; it's a pure oscillation with a specific "speed"
of oscillation.

If there are enough significant sinusoids with low frequencies --- those that
oscillate slowly ---, then it will take a long time for the function to repeat.
So if you consider a short segment of the function, it might not look repeating
at all.

Let's consider, abstractly, what a fourier transform of me is.

Repeating might not be a good thing; I don't want to keep making the same
mistakes; repeating is the absence of progress.

You might say that repeating a good habit is a good thing; for example reading
every day. But that repeated action changes me every time; it does carry
progress.

The fourier transform analogy perhaps suggests the depressing message that we
are all bound to repeat ourselves.

But we don't exist forever. In the amount of time we have, we can make progress.
Much like considering the function over a short segment of time, we should focus
on the progress we can make in the time we have.

So in order to make progress, the most prominent frequencies need to be
comparable to our life span.

This is a funny analogy between math and life. I call this "Fourier Me", which
shows how bad I am at naming things.
